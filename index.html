          I am Gordon James Ramsey. In 1998, I opened my own restaurent in
          Chelsea, with the help of my father. In 2011, The Good Food Guide
          listed my Restaurant 'Gordon Ramsay' as the second best in the UK,
          only bettered by The Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire. In July 2006, I won
          the Catey award for "Independent Restaurateur of the Year", becoming
          only the third person to have won three Catey awards. In September
          2006, I was named as the most influential person in the UK hospitality
          industry in the annual Caterersearch 100 list, published by Caterer
          and Hotelkeeper magazine.

          <h2>Smoked Salt Steak Rub</h2>

          <p>
            This steak rub recipe can be adapted to fit your own preferences and
            works well on chicken and pork too. Try adding a little smoked
            paprika to the rub or some dried herbs. It’s best to marinate the
            steak the night before so that the salt can properly infuse and
            tenderise the meat.
